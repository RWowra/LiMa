define({'Grace mode':{d:'Licenses can be either permanent or limited for a certain period. If you are borrowing a license from a license server, for instance, this is always limited to a certain date, which you can enter upon borrowing.\nThe Grace mode offers a defined contingent of days of usage in which the software can be used without a license. Only the actual days of usage will be counted. The available contingent depends on the ETAS software offering the Grace mode. It can be disabled or provides up to 14 days of usage.\nOnce this contingent has been used up, the ETAS software can be run only after installing a valid license.',l:''}});
